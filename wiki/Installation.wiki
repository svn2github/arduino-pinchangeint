= Introduction =

The PinChangeInt code is delivered in a zip file with associated examples and other code.  Here's how to install it.

= Details =

Go to your Arduino's libraries folder.  Look in your Arduino IDE for the library path, if you don't know it.  To do so, open up the Preferences menu item and look at the *Sketchbook location* entry.  The libraries path will be in the `libraries` directory beneath the Sketchbook location.

On Linux or MacOS, cd to there.  On Windows, your unzip tool may have a location where you want to unzip your files.  Make sure it is in the Sketchbook location.  Also make sure that you recreate full paths, if your zip tool has that option as well.  The command line `unzip` tool will properly create all subdirectories in the zip archive.

Extract the zip file there.  On Linux or MacOS:
{{{
unzip /path/to/pinchangeint-v1.4.zip
}}}
This will install the following files and directories:
{{{
PinChangeInt/PinChangeInt.h
PinChangeInt/keywords.txt
PinChangeInt/Examples/PinChangeIntExample.pde
PinChangeInt/Examples/PinChangeIntSpeedTest.pde
cppfix/cppfix.h
MemoryFree/MemoryFree.cpp
MemoryFree/MemoryFree.h
}}}
The cppfix directory is necessary only for Arduino versions prior to 1.0.  If you are using Arduino-1.0 or above, you can remove it.

The MemoryFree library is included for running speed and size tests.  If you don't want it, you can remove it.

Files
{{{
PinChangeInt/PinChangeInt.cpp
PinChangeInt/PinChangeIntConfig.h
}}}
are deprecated starting in Version 1.4 and will no longer be installed.
