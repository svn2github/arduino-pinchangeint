#summary Speed tests of the PinChangeInt library

= Introduction =

I have conducted extensive speed tests of this library, since its functionality is so fundamental to Interrupts.  See the PDF file.  An ODT file (OpenDocument format) file is available by request.


= Details =

I have created a report using LibreOffice.  I present a PDF version for download in the Downloads section..

Note that in the document I discuss a fork of this library, ooPinChangeInt.  See http://code.google.com/p/oopinchangeint/
