#summary Speed tests of the PinChangeInt library

= Introduction =

I have conducted extensive speed tests of this library, since its functionality is so fundamental to Interrupts.  See the PDF file.  An ODT file (OpenDocument format) file is available by request.


= Details =

I have created a report using LibreOffice.  I also present a PDF version.

Note that in the document I discuss an upcoming release, ooPinChangeInt-1.0.  It is not available as of yet (15 Jan. 2012).  As they say, "Coming soon!"
