#summary How to Use the PinChangeInt Library

=Introduction=

How to use the PinChangeInt library in your own programs.  Here I assume you have properly installed the library.  See the Installation wiki page for more information.

=The Quick and Dirty Method=
In your sketch, include:
{{{
#include <PinChangeInt.h>
}}}
Create a quick function that the library will call whenever your pin(s) are interrupted:
{{{
uint8_t latest_interrupted_pin;
void quicfunc() {
  latest_interrupted_pin=PCintPort::arduinoPin;
}
}}}
Decide if you want to interrupt on RISING, FALLING, or CHANGE of signal.  In `setup()`, attach an interrupt to your pin.  Here, we attach to pin 2:
{{{
PCintPort::attachInterrupt(2, &quicfunc, CHANGE);
}}}
You are done.  In this case, whenever pin 2 changes, `quicfunc()` will get called, and variable `latest_interrupted_pin` will be set to `2`.  Your `loop()` can poll `latest_interrupted_pin` whenever it wants.  `quicfunc()` can be more elaborate, but it should be quick because it is called by an interrupt.
