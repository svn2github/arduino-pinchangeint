Bugs and caveats here

== Incompatible with SoftwareSerial Library ==
SoftwareSerial uses Pin Change Interrupts, and as a result it is indeed in direct conflict with this library.

The only way to make them compatible would be to do something like this:

 * Figure out which port(s) you want to use for Software Serial.
 * Figure out which port(s) you want to use for Pin Change Interrupts.

Set up the #defines in Pin Change Interrupts so as to shut off the Software Serial ports:
{{{
#define NO_PORTx_PINCHANGES
}}}

Copy the SoftwareSerial library (`SoftwareSerial.h` and `SoftwareSerial.cpp`) to your personal libraries folder; call it mySoftwareSerial or something like this.  Do a global namechange from SoftwareSerial to mySoftwareSerial.

Delete the appropriate ISR in mySoftwareSerial.  For example, if you knew you weren't going to use PORTD for SoftwareSerial, you would delete:
{{{
#if defined(PCINT2_vect)
ISR(PCINT2_vect)
{
  SoftwareSerial::handle_interrupt();
}
#endif 
}}}
and so on.

So this is a limitation, not a bug.
